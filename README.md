# File Organizer 

Goal: My goal was to clean up NAS device which had 8TB of old photos and videos that were backed up since 2001. I wanted to clean up the drive by removing duplicates and creating subdirectories for images and videos based on the desired type. I used a custom dataset to fine tune the model. 

Next work: Using RAG or a file system MCP server that links my model to the file system so accurate results can be provided to make the results more meaningful.

Model Used: deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-1.3b-base
Custom Dataset used
